# Check if the subject can do evrything to the target.
# It's the opposite of the matcher "not be_able_to_do_anything".
#
# IMPORTANT: Only works when used with "should".
#
# Examples:
#   it { should be_able_to_do_everything_to(object) }
#   it { should be_able_to_do_everything_to(object).except(:read) }
#
# If your target object has custom actions, you have to set them first, otherwise
# they won't be considered! You can do something like this in your :
#
#   module Helpers
#     module ClassMethods
#       # Sets the custom actions that should also be checked by
#       # the matcher BeAbleToDoEverythingToMatcher
#       def set_custom_ability_actions(actions)
#         before(:each) do
#           Shoulda::Matchers::ActiveModel::BeAbleToDoEverythingToMatcher.custom_actions = actions
#         end
#       end
#     end
#   end
#
#   # in your `spec_helper.rb`:
#   config.extend Helpers::ClassMethods
#
#   # in your specs:
#   set_custom_ability_actions([:play, :other_custom_action])
#
