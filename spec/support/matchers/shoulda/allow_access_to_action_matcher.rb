module Shoulda # :nodoc
  module Matchers
    module ActionController # :nodoc

      # Ensures that the given action is not forbidden (403)
      #
      # Options:
      # * <tt>via</tt> - Method to be used (default to get): :get, :post,
      #   :put, :delete.
      # * <tt>redirecting_to</tt> - Check that the user was redirected to this
      #   route.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #   before { login_as(@user) }
      #   it { should allow_access_to(:index) }
      #   it { should allow_access_to(:destroy).via(:delete) }
      #   it { should allow_access_to(:show).redirecting_to("/users/1") }
      #   it { should_not allow_access_to(:create, { :id => @post }).via(:post) }
      #   it { should_not allow_access_to(:update, { :id => @post }).via(:put) }
      #
      # Notes:
      #  * Avoid using negation with the `redirecting_to` option, we will not work
      #    as expected. Example:
      #      it { should_not allow_access_to(:show).redirecting_to("/users/1") } # BAD!
      #  * The target action is stubbed, so if you're using CanCan's `authorize!` inside
      #    the action, it will not work!
